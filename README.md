# Nomination-Website

## What this is
This is a website that I worked on to outline my past work with UNSW societies and promote my goals and ambitions with UNSW CSESoc when running for president. It involves a mixture of Sass, CSS, Javascript and HTML. Due to the short timeframe of the student society campaign period, the process lent itself to building off the foundations of an experienced programmer's work. Hence, I opted to utilise an online template and edit the interactions of the website to suit my purposes. This involved redefining the interactions and framing of objects for the display as well as creating new css, animations and html objects. Ultimately, building upon the foundation provided by @ajlkn, I was able to create something of my own that showed off my goals for the campaign as well as my past work whilst providing interested voters an avenue to reach myself. Furthermore, this serves as my exploration into front end web development and helped me build my skills with front end development. You can view the end result here:
